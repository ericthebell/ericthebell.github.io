### Goal: Redesign internal market research tool

#### Problem: Internal market research ignored

A large software company invests a great deal in internal market research, yet their Market Research Divisionâ€™s intranet page is underutilized and plagued with usability issues. We must balance the needs of researchers creating original research with the needs of employees seeking it out.

#### Ideation

Our requirements were to (1) make the Market Research page the authoritative source of research within the compani - none of that Forrester stuff, (2) Promote the internal researchers, and (3) Effectively disseminate the researchers insights.

#### Tools

Personas, user flow, and derived sitemap.

#### Solution: Market Research Explorer

Our solution blends the needs of the content creators and searchers. A faceted search capability meets searcher needs, backed by a metadata built on existing categories with limited social tagging. Researchers in turn are given prominence for the core insights generated from their research, which are a distinct content type. The homepage allows customizability for easy refernce of new research in areas relevant to the individual user.
