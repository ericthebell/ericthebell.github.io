A project at Startup Weekend Berkeley. Winner of the Best Pitch award.

#### Concentrating on the problem

Startups, especially the products of hackathons, are focusd on creating a functional product. Their creators in turn want to focus on building out their idea. However, when marketing is not their forte, founders often unnecessarily fall short in selling the appeal of their idea.

#### Crowdsourced taglines

To alleviate this tragic shortcoming, Word Herd uses talented writers to crowdsource business names and taglines. Writers compete to submit taglines. Customers in turn determine the best submission. Winning writers are rewarded, and customers obtain a quality tagline for a bargain price.

I sketched out a general direction, and while the team built and iterated on our v1 site, I prototyped v2 functionality and an initial mobile version.
