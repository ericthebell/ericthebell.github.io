 **UX Guy**

UX team-of-one (and Employee #2) at [Addvocate](https://addvocate.com/), a social media startup, which I joined in the fall of 2012. While I was there, the company went from angel funding to a successful Series A, and grew from four people in a coworking space to a team of ten moving into our own offices.

**Enterprise social media what?**

Addvocate is a social platform to better connect people within an organization while empowering employee advocacy. As the only designer for most of my tenure, I collaborated closely with our back and front end engineers and focused on quickly iterating around the minimal amount of deliverables needed to communicate designs.

**Cross-channel UX**

I was responsible for designing a holistic experience for Addvocate, starting with our marketing website and onboarding, continuing with product use on web and mobile.

**Product design**

Web and mobile app design and prototyping, all features and functionality, from information architecture through interaction design and user testing. Worked with developers throughout to navigate technical constraints while designing and negotiating issues arising during implementation.

**Marketing website design**

Structure, layout, interactions, content strategy, copy editing, and directing the visual design. Designed and tested onboarding flow experience, working closely with engineers.

**User research**

Testing prototypes and production versions of web app, mobile apps, and marketing site. Remote user testing of onboarding flow and web app, in-person user testing of mobile, tracking of quantitative analytics.

**Creative direction and design management**

Managed remote designers working on visual design and branding.

**Product management**

Created product roadmaps. Negotiated priorities and scheduling of product features, as needed.
