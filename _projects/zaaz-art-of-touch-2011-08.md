The Art of Touch site showcased Microsoft’s much-hailed Touch Mouse, a multitouch wireless mouse akin to Apple’s Magic Mouse. I was brought in after considerable visual concepts and the basic art tool had already been established.

My responsibility was to:- Stitch together intuitive user flows
- Enforce consistency of interactions throughout the novel site
- Build out the logic behind artwork creation
- Contribute to contest participation incentives
