### Problem

Two pharmaceutical manufacturers are competing to get FDA approval for the first cell therapy for leukemia, a blood cancer. The larger pharma company opts to build their own software solution. The smaller company partners with Vineti.

At a small clinical trial scale, the logistical complexity of a cell therapy treatment can be managed with heavy manual coordination.

In order to scale commercially, that logistical complexity requires automation and tracking in order to safely scale (and therefore be FDA approved) as a commercial product.

### Process

- stakeholder interviews & process capture
- primary persona & scenario synthesis
- on-site observational research
- prototyping testing
- iteration & polish

### Solution

- Bite-sized guided **hospital workflows** for nurse attending patient.
- Planning & scheduling **manufacturing capacity** & calculated logistics.
- A patient **treatment overview** for case managers of the calculated schedule.
