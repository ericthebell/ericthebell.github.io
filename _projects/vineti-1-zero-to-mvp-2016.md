### Problem
Two pharmaceutical manufacturers are competing to get FDA approval for the first cell therapy for leukemia, a blood cancer. The larger pharma company opts to build their own software solution. The smaller company partners with Vineti.
At a small clinical trial scale, the logistical complexity of a cell therapy treatment can be managed with heavy manual coordination.
In order to scale commercially, that logistical complexity requires automation and tracking in order to safely scale (and therefore be FDA approved) as a commercial product.

### Process
stakeholder
interviews & process capture
primary persona & scenario synthesis
on-site observational research
prototyping testing
iteration & polish

### Solution
Bite-sized guided hospital workflows for nurse attending patient.
Planning & scheduling manufacturing capacity & calculated logistics.
A patient treatment overview for case managers of the calculated schedule.

### Impact
FDA approval and successful commercial launch of Kite Gilead's Yescarta leukemia treatment
FDA commercial approval
4k patient treatments delivered
This solution ultimately delivered ~4,000 patient treatments over the course of the next 5 years.
