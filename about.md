**Hello there,** I'm Eric, a digital product and service designer who came out of library science and has spent my career solving information problems, from "how can this keyboard intuitively teach faster gesture-based typing" to "how might we seamlessly orchestrate the scheduling, hospital collection, shipping, cleanroom manufacturing, and patient infusion of a personalized cell therapy?"

**Design is** the process of intentionally solving a problem. UX is not about looking pretty, it's about solving user problems to achieve business goals. 
Product design is doing that in the context of a digital product. 
Service design is about creating that holistic experience across disparate products and touchpoints, supported by behind-the-scenes coordination between multiple internal teams or departments.

**What I bring** is a holistic vision of a cross-product experience, and the facilitation to unify a complicated cross-department experience, as well as design mentorship across the team to support those efforts.

**I've shipped** three startups from soup to nuts, optimized existing products, and I visualizing and aligning product strategy and execution. I have a bad habit of sticking through a project until it succeeds or dies under my feet.

The last six years I spent leading the design team at [Vineti](https://vineti.com/), where we built a platform to orchetsrate the next generation of cell nd gene therapy treatments. Before that I directed product design on the Rakuten Manga project, a platform for fans to translate digital comics into their own language, and I formed and facilitated the design team at Viki, a Rakuten subsidiary. I've worked at a small social media startup, design agencies in Tokyo and Seattle, and designed the Japanese input methods for Microsoft's erstwhile Windows Phone 7.

**Currently I'm looking** for *complex system & service problems* to work on, an *established design team* to learn from & mentor, who are *geographically distributed* with intentional onsites.

<!-- **I design things** based on the people who use them. Iâ€™m particularly good at wrapping my head around novel systems and making complexity understandable to its audience. I see most of these situations as information problems. My specialties are Interaction Design and Information Architecture. I approach products, services, and cross-channel experiences holistically. -->
