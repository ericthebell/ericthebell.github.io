**Hello there!** I'm Eric, a digital product and service designer who came out of library science. I'm a UX generalist who specializes in complex, behind-the-scenes challenges that span multiple user groups or internal teams. 

<!--more--> 

<!-- 
I've spent my career solving information and interaction problems, from "how can this keyboard intuitively teach faster gesture-based typing" to "how might we seamlessly orchestrate the scheduling, hospital collection, shipping, cleanroom manufacturing, and infusion of a drug made with one patient's white blood cells?" Sometimes I'm the first or only designer at a startup, sometimes I've come into an existing team and help unify priorities and align processes.

**Design is** the process of measurably solving someone's problem. UX is not about looking pretty, it's about solving user problems to achieve business goals (and looking pretty can be an important part of that solution). _Product design_ is doing that in the context of a digital product. _Service design_ is about creating that holistic experience across disparate products and touchpoints, supported by behind-the-scenes coordination between multiple internal teams or departments. Most design disciplines involve a similar bucket of skills and tools, with variations in scale and focus.
-->

**What I bring** to a team is a holistic vision of a cross-product experience, and the facilitation to unify complicated cross-department experiences, as well as design mentorship to support those efforts.

**I've shipped** three startups from soup to nuts, optimized existing products, and I visualizing and aligning product strategy and execution. I have a bad habit of sticking through a project until it succeeds or dies under my feet.

The last six years I spent leading the design team at [Vineti](https://vineti.com/), where we built a platform to orchetsrate the next generation of cell nd gene therapy treatments. Before that I directed product design on the Rakuten Manga project, a platform for fans to translate digital comics into their own language, and I formed and facilitated the design team at Viki, a Rakuten subsidiary. I've worked at a small social media startup, design agencies in Tokyo and Seattle, and designed the Japanese input methods for Microsoft's erstwhile Windows Phone 7.

	<strong>I'm passionate</strong> about many topics, and I'm a sucker for diving into a new industry. Some special interests include healthcare, crowdsourcing, security, process design, team hiring/interviewing, system modeling, guerrilla research, design patterns, hackathons.

**Currently I'm looking** for *complex system & service problems* to work on, an *established design team* to learn from & mentor, who are *geographically distributed* with intentional onsites. 

<!-- **I design things** based on the people who use them. I’m particularly good at wrapping my head around novel systems and making complexity understandable to its audience. I see most of these situations as information problems. My specialties are Interaction Design and Information Architecture. I approach products, services, and cross-channel experiences holistically. -->

### Team dynamics
**Feedback**. Is a gift. Sharing or receiving, nothing is personal. Everything is a data point towards insights to align impact with goals.

**Conflict**. We are a team not a family. Let's confront our disagreements constructively rather than avoid the conflict.

**Safety**. Emotional safety is critical for a collaborative team that wants to tackle its risks rather than hide them. How might we support each other to continue improving our dynamics?

### Collaboration
**Pairing**. Working together live saves communication disconnects and dramatically shortens feedback loops, let's schedule some time.

**Visibility**. I believe in passive visibility of team work, via information radiators or shared task boards, to create awareness and allow for serendipitous interactions.

**Synchronicity**. My preferred work dynamic is intentional synchronous pairing balanced with focused async execution and visible team communication. How might we find the best work cadence so that we can all maintain our most sustainably productive team routines?

**Presence**. Distributed by default, on-site by intention. Let's meet up in-person 2-4x year for project intensives.

### Work mindset
**Process nerd**. There are so many ways to get things done, let's figure out the project mindsets that work best for us.

**Librarian**. Many coworkers have told me I'm the most organized person they know. I habitually take notes and synthesize takeaways and follow-up tasks.

**Information Architect**. My mental model is not yours. Let's find the right balance of structure and flexibility to maximize everyone's mental model for where things should go.

## Accolades

I shy away from trumpeting myself, but my colleagues do seem to keep saying nice things about me.
