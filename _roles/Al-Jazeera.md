Al Jazeera's mission is to give voice to the voiceless
. The digital team managed the publishing platform and web and mobile front ends for multiple editorial bureaus. My focus was to evaluate the state of the mobile app, then to create and guide implementation of a vision to address its biggest opportunities, while mentoring the product design team.

## Voice to the voiceless

Al Jazeera's digital team works to support multiple editorial bureaus working across four language regions. The mobile app specifically had taken a controversial new direction and needed a holistic vision. And the design team was fragmented across product teams, without its own leadership.

## Team & role

**Lead Product Designer**. I joined the mobile team to focus on high priority needs within the app, while providing guidance for individual designers fragmented across other teams.

## Approach

### Mobile baseline evaulation & scoping

Conducting a thorough review of the mobile experience, including heuristic evaluation, user flow analytics, stakeholder interviews. Identified biggest impact opportunities, crossed with gaps in the existing roadmap.

### Product roadmap scoping

Fleshing out each high priority project area and its strategic approach.
- Problem definition and context
- Strategic approach to each solution
- Which stakeholders it supports
- Conceptual solution examples and scoping

### Mobile overhaul and design system

Built out a Figma design system from scratch, both to align mobile app branding and style with web, and as a design team collaboration exercise.

**Priority projects execution**. Executed on top slice MVPs of remaining highest priority projects from original synthesis. Including filling functionality gaps between mobile and web, addressing critical mobile usability issues, and optimizing the onboarding experience.
