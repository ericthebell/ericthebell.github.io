Al Jazeera's mission is to be the voice of the voiceless. The digital team managed the publishing platform and web and mobile front ends for multiple editorial bureaus. My focus was to evaluate the state of the mobile app, then to create and guide implementation of a vision to address its biggest opportunities, while mentoring the product design team.

### Voice of the voiceless

Al Jazeera's digital team works to support mustiple edutorial bureaus working ocress four language regions. Within the digital team, I came in to support the product design team, which had lacked design leadership for some time. I joined the mobile team to focus on high priority needs with the app, while providing guidance for individual designers fragmented across other teams.

### Approach

**Mobile baseline evaulation and scoping**. Conducting a thorough review of the mobile experience, including heuristic evaluation, user flow analytics, stakeholder interviews. Identified biggest impact opportunities, and scoped high priority project areas and strategic approaches for each.

Including building a Figma design system from scratch to align mobile app branding and style with web, filling functionality gaps between mobile and web, addressing critical mobile usability issues, and optimizing the onboarding experience.
