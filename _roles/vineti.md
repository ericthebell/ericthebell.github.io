Vineti is the proven clinical-to-commercial **platform for cell & gene therapy supply chain management**.

Vineti was founded to solve the key challenges faced by patients, medical providers, pharmaceutical companies, and regulators in **the delivery and commercialization of personalized medicine**.

From the ground up, I **researched, designed, prototyped, expanded and scaled** the configurable, cross-channel patient treatment logistics platform. Worked with balanced teams and mentored growing design team throughout.
