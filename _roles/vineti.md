Vineti was founded to solve the key challenges faced by patients, medical providers, pharmaceutical companies, and regulators in **the delivery and commercialization of personalized medicine**.

Vineti became the proven clinical-to-commercial **platform for cell & gene therapy supply chain management**.

From the ground up, I **researched, designed, prototyped, expanded and scaled** the configurable, cross-channel patient treatment logistics platform. Worked with balanced teams and mentored growing design team throughout.

### Cell & Gene Therapy

Cell & gene therapies (CGT) are biologic drugs manufactured using the cells (blood or tissue) of a patient. They involve some of the most complex workflows in medicine, and require careful tracking across a series of locations.

### Solution

Vineti built a platform for clinical and commercial cell & gene therapy supply chain management. The Dominos Pizza TrackerTM for cell therapies, if you will.

### Impact

Vineti's platform supported therapies across 26 disease indications, delivering treatments to ~5,000 patients before exit.
