An accessibly editable template for tracking your lean startup experiments, using Figma Slides. Go ahead and [check it out](https://www.figma.com/slides/Hv3GJxpUCt0NU8qFs6dMMF/Experiment-tracking-dashboard-%5Btemplate%5D?node-id=1-26&t=Jv8o14Xs2BjpbGRw-1), or read on for the story.

## Context & challenge

A couple years ago, four former coworkers and I embarked on an effort to turn [HyeTech](https://hyetech.io), a networking community with ad hoc volunteer events, into a sustainable business.<label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">HyeTech's <a href="https://www.hyetech.io/vision-and-mission">vision</a> is for the Armenian tech network to become an indispensable global asset that creates positive impact on the world.</span>

During that initial stage, our biggest constraint was bandwidth, and our biggest risk was trying to do too many things or jumping to start new things rather than finish current efforts.

At the time, I was also still fully employed at our [erstwhile workplace](/roles/Vineti) (and later, focusing on the job search), and I only had a handful of hours a week to devote to any support activities. We had a granular backlog, but no high level view of our work, so it was easy for our attention to become fragmented.

This template was born out of my attempts to encourage us to more aggressively scope our goals, and to focus only on intentionally prioritized projects. And at the end of the day, this is merely a reconfiguration of the Lean Startup model of identifying your biggest risks/assumptions and coming up with experiments to (in)validate them.

## Experiments in a backlog

I wanted to capture a couple concepts in a manageable single-view format: the Lean Startup approach of using experiments to validate your riskiest assumptions,<label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-1"	class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote"><a href="https://leanstartup.co/resources/articles/lean-startup-method/">Lean Startup 101</a></span>
and Marty Cagan's <a href="https://www.svpg.com/dual-track-agile/">Dual-Track Agile</a> idea of parallel validation and implementation backlogs.<label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-1"	class="margin-toggle"/>

I drew on a few references for the experiment layout,<label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

as well as comments I remembered [Javid Jamae](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamae/) making about maintaining a slide deck of current and planned experiments.<label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

## First iteration & learnings

My first iteration was a Miro board that captured a general template for an experiment card, along with a path for experiments to move from a prioritized backlog to.

<figure>
	<label for="mn-miro" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label>
	<input type="checkbox" id="mn-miro" class="margin-toggle">
	<span class="marginnote">Our experiments moved slowly, so this approach represented a reasonable amount of manual updating.</span>
	<img src="/assets/images/experiments-miro.png" alt="experiments flow">
</figure>

Miro was useful for organizing everything in a readable zoomed out view, while flexibly updating individual cards without too much concern for actual slide deck constraints. For a tool to review and update as a team, this format worked great and helped our focus for a year or so.

The downsides of Miro, for our team, were that despite Miro's accessible editing, I was still the only person who actually went in to make updates, and it was challenging to foster, in teammates who didn't otherwise have much of a reason to live in the tool, an asynchronous habit of checking Miro. And while Miro is much more accessible than Figma for non-designers, moving around between individual cards and between high level and granular views involved relatively manual navigation.

## Figma remake & tradeoffs

Recently, Figma released a slides tool<label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-1"	class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote"><a href="">Figma Slides</a> blends Figma's design tools with a familiar slide layout.</span>
that offers a bridge to users more familiar with presentation tools, for whom the designer's view of Figma is intimidatingly complex.<label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">Similar to how their recently released <a href="https://www.figma.com/dev-mode/">Dev Mode</a> caters to the needs and conventions of developers who are implementing designs.</span>
The combination of individual slide view with a flexible deck overview looked like it had potential for our needs, so I tried adapting my Miro approach to Figma.

The clear advantage of Figma Slides for our experiment dashboard template is the familiar slide UI, with more accessible editing and navigation. The format lowers the bar for reference and editing by non-designer stakeholders.

<figure>
	<label for="mn-figma-slides" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label>
	<input type="checkbox" id="mn-figma-slides" class="margin-toggle">
	<span class="marginnote">A slicker PowerPoint.</span>
	<img src="/assets/images/experiments-figma-slide.png" alt="experiments flow">
</figure>

The primary tradeoff of the slide view is the lack of flexibility in slide dimensions. Despite Figma's ability to use autolayout to dynamically adjust template content within constraints, they chose to keep a strict fixed dimension for individual slides. In our case, this means that if we have a particularly large amount of content for a particular experiment (detailed plans, large list of metrics, etc), then we either need to make harder choices about what needs capturing, or we need to split an experiment across a couple slides.

	<label for="mn-figma-overview" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label>
	<input type="checkbox" id="mn-figma-overview" class="margin-toggle">

## Template notes

See below for the embedded deck, which you are welcome to try out for yourself if this concept is helpful for your own team. Some notes:
- Figma doesn't yet appear to support components in Slides, unfortunately, so for now there doesn't seem to be a way to edit the template across all slides. That said, besides the two-slide version and the Appendix examples, you should be able to tweak the primary template to your needs without too much hassle.  
- At the moment, only Figma employees and hand-picked designers can publish their contributions to the Figma Community, so for now this is simply a public link to my template file.
- Feedback welcome as comments directly in this file!<label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

You can try messaging me on other platforms, but commenting directly is the most contextually helpful.
