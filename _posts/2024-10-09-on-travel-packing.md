</span>I spent my COVID lockdown watching a lot of YouTube videos about minimalist packing strategies.

## Lockdown hobby

During the first year of COVID, I was stuck in my rather isolating solo apartment. That same year, my boss at the time<label for="sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

and encouraging us to actually pursue them. For me, that included goals to work in our other offices and from new locations.

I've always been a lightweight packer, but with one-off packing lists and inconsistent organization. After a year of minimalist packing videos and lists, I came out of lockdown with a significantly optimized setup to start experimenting with digital nomading and sustainable travel strategies. 

## General lessons

After iterating through a lot of minimalist packing ideas and finding a good balance for me, my primary lessons included the usefulness of packing cubes, switching a lot of clothing to merino wool, and creating checklist templates so I didn't have to worry about reinventing my packing needs each trip.

**Packing cubes**. They're great for organizing things, though not necessarily for saving space. For me they help with the mental (as well as literal) compartmentalization of what types of things I'm packing and keeping track of. *Bonus*: When I get to a destintation, I can keep using them as "drawers" during my stay.

**Rolling clothes**. Rolling up all my clothes simplified some things for me. I appreciate the compactness, ease of seeing and sorting them, and marginal reduction in wrinkles.<label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<span class="sidenote">Also called the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QyYgZ6Lrqg">Ranger Roll or Army Roll</a> method.</span>

**Merino wool**.  Wool undershirts, overshirts, and socks are the way to go, with some caveats. For shirts and socks, they really do last forever and smell astoundingly less than cotton or synthetics. Undershirts and socks I can wear multiple days in a row, and I have a couple overshirts that I haven't needed to wash for over a year each.<label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<span class="sidenote">
When I heard about Wool & Prince's <a href="https://woolandprince.com/blogs/everyday-merino/your-next-shirt-could-be-on-us">100-day challenge</a> I thought it was nonsense, but actually it was an understatement.
</span>

*Tradeoffs*: Merino wool is notably expensive, and finding properly soft undershirts can be a challenge.<label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

And wool isn't suitable for everything (underwear and vests in particular I've stuck with synthetic and fleece, respectively).<label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

**Hand-washing**. Getting used to washing things in the sink really changed the scale of what I need to pack. While I do still generally pack a week of clothes (and count on a laundry machine at my destination), I discovered that I really only need three sets. Wear one, wash another, let the third dry. With wool and synthetics, most things air dry in a few hours. Some months I exclusively washed everything in the sink. It shifted my mindset from "packing everything to last for X days" to "a rotating wardrobe for an indefinite period of time."

**Solid toiletries**. Having to keep a separate plastic bag for liquid toiletries really messes up the clean geometry of my suitcase, so I was motivated to remove the need for it at airport security. I gradually switched out all of my liquid toiletries, specifically toothpaste tablets, a conditioner bar (I haven't used shampoo in years), and a shaving soap stick. YMMV.

## Bags and lists

My setup is primarily based around a suitcase and a backpack. These are the size constraints I focused on.

**Suitcase + backpack**. A suitcase small enough for international carry-on, and a backpack small enough not to be obnoxious for commuting or day trips. As tempting as it was to try for a single backpack large enough for one-bag travel, my back is not as young as it used to be and physically carrying less is more relaxing. I do include a sling for everyday wear, that among other things is big enough to hold my iPad, but for travel days it gets packed away.<label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

**Checklists**. I also made a packing list for each bag and turned them into Trello card templates, with the annotated photo as the thumbnail for each one.

## Other people's advice

There are endless resources and videos on these topics, and if you have the stomach for them many are insightful.
- [*Pack Hacker's digital nomad packing list*](https://packhacker.com/packing-list/digital-nomad/). The digital nomad lists tend to be full of newer and niftier things, but there’s no real need to get specialized expensive stuff (except maybe wool), it’s more about the mindset and thinking through your needs. They have a budget travel packing list, too.

Thanks for reading, and I hope you found something useful.
