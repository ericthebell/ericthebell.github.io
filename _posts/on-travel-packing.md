I spent lockdown watching a lot of YouTube videos about minimalist packing strategies.

## Context

During lockdown, I got into minimalist travel and efficient packing strategies. 

For me, this mostly meant discovering the usefulness of packing cubes for organization and switching a lot of my clothing to merino wool. I also ended up making checklist templates, so that I didn't have to worry about reinventing my packing needs for each trip.

After lockdown, this left me with a great setup to start experimenting with digital nomading and sustainable travel strategies.

## My lessons

As far as strategic approaches, my big lessons have been:
- Packing cubes are great for organizing things (not really for saving space), like having “drawers” for each type of thing that’s easy to pack and keep track of.
- Rolling up clothes is the way to go.
- Merino wool undershirts and overshirts are the way to go (but hard/expensive to find really soft ones), also socks. Synthetic underwear not merino, though.
- Getting used to washing things in the sink (I can basically survive on three sets of clothes indefinitely, with wool and synthetics that hang dry fast). Basically, decide if you’re packing “everything to last for X days” or “an indefinite length of an X-day-long rotating wardrobe”.
- One weird thing I did was get rid of all my liquid toiletries (solid conditioner, toothpaste tablets, etc), in order to avoid having to take things out at airport security, but that might be extreme.

## My examples

After thinking through

As far as concrete examples, I did document some things like how I pack a suitcase and bag.

I also made a checklist template in Trello for each bag, with the above photo as the thumbnail for each one.
- Suitcase list
- Backpack list (regular and one-bag versions)
- General list (planning and apartment cleanup items)

## Other people’s advice

There are endless videos on this sort of thing, but if you have the stomach for them they’re often insightful
- [*Digital nomad packing resources*](https://packhacker.com/packing-list/digital-nomad/). The digital nomad lists tend to be full of new/fancy/pricy things, but there’s no real need to get specialized expensive stuff (except maybe wool), it’s more about the mindset and thinking through your needs. That same site has a budget travel packing list, too.
- [*A couple describes their overall approach and lessons*](https://youtu.be/M4WxFM2uV2U). They also have one talking about what they've found merino wool is actually useful for.
