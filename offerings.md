## Let’s work together

Hire me to collaboratively define and tackle your top product priorities, visually align stakeholders, and up-level your team along the way. 

Together we’ll clarify business goals, research and plan out a viable path to implementation, and collaborate on team processes to get this and future projects done.

### Why work with me

I’ve solved a wide range of design and research problems over the past 15 years, at new startups and established companies, as a design team of one and as the team builder, across a range of industries and countries.

My past 15 years I’ve spent
* **working** at 4 `startups`, 1 `enterprise`, 2 `consultancies`; 
* with **teams** in `US, Japan, Armenia, Singapore, Qatar, and India`; 
* **building** 4 `consumer products` (4 years) and 1 `enterprise platform` (7 years)
* across **industries** of `regulated healthcare, social media, crowdsourced translation, video streaming,and internationalization projects`.

Three times I’ve been the `founding designer`, and three times I’ve `built or managed` the design team.

I am **especially passionate** about hiring process design, pair designing, cross-team collaboration, security usability, design localization, and asynchronous & remote coordination.

There are also some good reasons why my experiences may not be an automatic fit for your needs. The ability to

**Change management at scale**. Identifying and solving operational and cultural inefficiencies I can do, but I am not the person to roll out a slow, phased, effort to change employee behavior across a large organization.
