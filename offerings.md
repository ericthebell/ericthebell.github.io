## Let’s work together

Hire me to collaboratively define and tackle your top product priorities, visually align stakeholders, and up-level your team along the way. 

Together we’ll clarify business goals, research and plan out a viable path to implementation, and collaborate on team processes to get this and future projects done.

### Why work with me

I’ve solved a wide range of design and research problems over the past 15 years, at new startups and established companies, as a design team of one and as the team builder, across a range of industries and countries.

My past 15 years I’ve spent
* **working** at 4 `startups`, 1 `enterprise`, 2 `consultancies`; 
* with **teams** in `US`, `Japan`, `Armenia`, `Singapore`, `Qatar`, and `India`; 
* **building** 4 `consumer products` (4 years) and 1 `enterprise platform` (7 years)
* across **industries** of `regulated healthcare`, `social media`, `crowdsourced translation`, `video streaming`,and `internationalization projects`.

Three times I’ve been the `founding designer`, and three times I’ve `built or managed` the design team.

I am **especially passionate** about hiring process design, pair designing, cross-team collaboration, security usability, design localization, and asynchronous & remote coordination.

### **Why _not_ me?** 

There are also some good reasons why my experiences may not be an automatic fit for your needs. While my strengths include the ability to dive into new domains and leverage that outside perspective as I ramp up, there are areas where my lack of experience may be relevant.

* **Larger bureaucracies**. I’ve spent most of my career in smaller organizations (&lt;20 design teams, &lt;500 org size), so while my insights will still be relevant to scaled organizations, navigating bureaucracies is not my most practiced skill. 
* **Change management at scale**. Identifying and solving operational and cultural inefficiencies I can do, but I am not the person to roll out a slow, phased, effort to change employee behavior across a large organization.
